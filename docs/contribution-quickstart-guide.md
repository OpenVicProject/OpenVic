# Project Setup

1. [Go to the main repository](https://github.com/OpenVicProject/OpenVic) page on Github

2. Get the link to clone the repo

3. Using Git, clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/OpenVicProject/OpenVic`

![](images/proj-setup/02-git-clone.png)

4. Move into the OpenVic directory: `cd OpenVic`

5. Retrieve submodules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

![](images/proj-setup/03-submodules.png)

6. Create and checkout a new git branch for your changes: `git switch -c my-cool-branch`
    - You should give your branch a descriptive name of the changes you intend to make

![](images/proj-setup/04-new-branch.png)

7. Build the C++ portion of the project by running `scons` in Powershell
    - It will take a minute to initially compile. Any future C++ changes only need to recompile the files that were changed and are much faster

8. Run the Godot executable

9. Select the 'Import' project button

10. Navigate to the `OpenVic/game/` directory and select the `project.godot` file

![](images/proj-setup/07-select-project.png)

11. Select "Import & Edit"

![](images/proj-setup/08-import-edit.png)

12. This will open the Godot editor! Make your changes as desired and press the "Play" button in the top-right corner to run the game in-editor.

# Contributing your changes!

Whenever you are ready to commit your changes follow this process:

1. Run `git status` to show what files are new or changed

![](images/contribution/01-status.png)

2. Run `git add ...` for each of the modified files

![](images/contribution/02-add.png)

3. Run `git commit -m "A descriptive commit message"` to make a commit with your staged changes

![](images/contribution/03-commit.png)

4. Run `git push` to upload your current commits to your working branch
    - If you're warned that your branch has no upstream branch, run `git push --set-upstream origin my-cool-branch`, replacing "`my-cool-branch`" with whatever your branch is named in [Part 6 of Project Setup](#project-setup)
