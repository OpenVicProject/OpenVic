        - If this feature was in Victoria II, please report a [Victoria II discrepancy](https://github.com/OpenVicProject/OpenVic/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=2-victoria-2-discrepancy.yml) instead.
        - If this feature only intends to include mechanical additions to the vanilla experience, please report it as a [gameplay feature request](https://github.com/OpenVicProject/OpenVic/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=3-gameplay-feature-request.yml).
        - Write a descriptive proposal title above.

      description: "Search [open](https://github.com/OpenVicProject/OpenVic/issues) and [closed](https://github.com/OpenVicProject/OpenVic/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) proposals to ensure this feature has not already been proposed. If there is a match, you can bump it or leave a comment with your ideas and concerns. If you don't find a relevant match or if you're not sure, don't hesitate to **open a new issue**. Contributors will handle it from there if it's a duplicate."

      description: If you need this for a specific modding project, specify above. This is important so that we know the *context* in which the feature is being proposed. Features used in real projects are more likely to be added.
      placeholder: Example - "A cold war overhaul mod"

  - type: textarea
    attributes:
      label: Problem
      description: Describe the problem or limitation within OpenVic you are running into in your project.
      placeholder: Example - "Victoria II's modding script doesn't have a traditional if statement, which makes our code more roundabout and less readable."

      required: true

  - type: textarea
    attributes:
      label: Solution
      description: Describe the feature / enhancement you're proposing and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation you're running into.
      placeholder: Example - "Add an if statement to OpenVic, so that we don't have to use if-emulation, and can clean up and simplify our code."
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    attributes:
      label: Existing Workaround?
      description: If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?
      placeholder: Example - "This can be worked around, but it is not particularly convenient."
