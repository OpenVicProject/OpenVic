        Thank you for filling out this bug report!

        When reporting a bug, please follow the guidelines in this template. This helps us quickly identify the problem you're having.
        - If this report is about a feature or behavior in Victoria II that is missing or working incorrectly in OpenVic, please report a [Victoria II Discrepancy](https://github.com/OpenVicProject/OpenVic/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=2-victoria-2-discrepancy.yml) instead.
        - Write a descriptive issue title above.
        - **Always open *one* issue for *one* bug**. If you notice several bugs, make sure to create one new issue for each of them.
        - Verify that you are using either the latest release or the latest commit. It is preferred that you check if your issue is reproducible in the latest commit - it may already have been fixed!
        - If you're playing with custom source modifications, please test if your bug is reproducible in the latest official build of OpenVic before opening an issue here.
